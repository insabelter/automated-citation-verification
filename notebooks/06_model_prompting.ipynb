      "finished, faulty sections are finally determined based on the fault confidence levels according to criterion rules. Because of the high requirement of fault diagnosis methods for processing fault information, the SNPS-based diagnosis methods have become a hot research topic with rich research results  [27-29, 33, 34] . However, up to now, the relevant research work is mainly focused on the fault diagnosis of power systems. Besides, the existing work mainly studies the postevent diagnosis problems. -erefore, to give full play to the excellent information processing ability and computing power of SNPSs, it is of great importance to expand their scope to different application fields, as well as extend the applications from the postante ones to new ex-ante analysis and prediction frameworks. -erefore, this paper moves forward in this widening of the scope of SNPSs. More specifically, the work proposes a fault analysis method based on modified fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems with real numbers (rMFRSNPSs) for threephase induction motors. As an important part of this new method presented here, the forward fault prediction reasoning algorithm (FFPRA) and the backward abductive fault diagnosis reasoning algorithm (BAFDRA) are proposed. -e main contributions of this paper\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "As an important part of industrial and agricultural productions, the normal operation of three-phase induction motors plays a pivotal role in economic benefits and security risks. For a motor, any potential failure that cannot be predicted or detected in time may produce damage on it, resulting in downtime with potentially huge economic losses  [1] [2] [3] [4] . In addition, when a motor has faults and is shut down, the first task is to perform abductive fault diagnosis to find its failure causes, which can effectively help the operation and maintenance personnels to locate faulty parts quickly. -erefore, fault prediction and abductive fault diagnosis are of great significance for improving the working reliability and stability of motors  [5] . -e fault prediction of a motor is usually realized based on an online monitoring system to detect the early failure symptoms and trend parameters that can reflect hidden troubles. -en, these symptoms and parameters are processed by prediction algorithms to obtain early-warning information and integrated decision making  [6]  to prevent motor failures. For example,  [7]  diagnosed mechanical faults of motors by vibration analysis, which was carried out through a noncontact approach based on an optical computer mouse and a digital signal processing device.

      "Abstract: Motivation: Proteases are enzymes that cleave target substrate proteins by catalyzing the hydrolysis of peptide bonds between specific amino acids. While the functional proteolysis regulated by proteases plays a central role in the 'life and death' cellular processes, many of the corresponding substrates and their cleavage sites were not found yet. Availability of accurate predictors of the substrates and cleavage sites would facilitate understanding of proteases' functions and physiological roles. Deep learning is a promising approach for the development of accurate predictors of substrate cleavage events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results: We propose DeepCleave, the first deep learning-based predictor of protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites. DeepCleave uses protein substrate sequence data as input and employs convolutional neural networks with transfer learning to train accurate predictive models. High predictive performance of our models stems from the use of high-quality cleavage site features extracted from the substrate sequences through the deep learning process, and the application of transfer learning, multiple kernels and attention layer in the design of the deep network. Empirical tests against several related state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that DeepCleave outperforms these methods in predicting caspase and matrix metalloprotease substrate-cleavage sites. \n",

However, even the results at the 2nd fully connected layer show overlap between some cleavage points associated with different caspases. This is not surprising since some sites are cleaved by several different proteases. In addition, we obtain similar results when using another visualization tool, t-SNE (van der  Maaten and Hinton, 2008) . The t-SNE plots are shown in Supplementary Figure  S3 . To sum up, our empirical results in Sections 3.1-3.3 suggest that the models trained on the protease-family cleavage data can be used to develop accurate cleavage prediction models.\n",

      "removed neurons are different in each batch of the training process, the corresponding networks are also different, resulting in 'new' models. Dropout reduces a potentially harmful co-adaptation of neurons because this way neurons do not depend on the presence of other specific neurons. Therefore, the network is forced to learn new features that are used in combination to improve predictions. As such, dropout is a useful to ensure that the prediction network model is robust to the loss of individual features  (Krizhevsky et al., 2017) . The 'early stopping' strategy stops training when the loss on the training set is not decreasing (i.e. the degree of reduction is less than a certain threshold). This solves the problem of manually setting the number of epochs and reduces chances of overfitting the network to the training set.\n",

We visualize this strategy in the 'Bootstrap' part of Figure  1B . Let P and N be the positive set (cleavage sites) and negative set (non-cleavage sites),\n",

Similar trend is true when using the average MCC, with the corresponding values equal 0.181, 0.463, 0.527, 0.510, 0.732 and 0.828. These results demonstrate that the one-hot encoding utilized in DeepCleave provides the best solution for the prediction of the protease cleavage sites using this particular neural network topology, although several other types of inputs are also predictive. The deep network that uses all inputs secures relatively high average AUC ¼ 0.865 and average MCC ¼ 0.635. However, these results are still lower than the results secured by the one-hot encoding. Again, we believe that this stems from the architecture of the network that favours the binary inputs. One important advantage of the one-hot encoding is that it can be efficiently computed from the input protein sequence, particularly when compared to a computationally expensive calculation of some\n",
