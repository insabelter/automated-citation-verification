      "Abstract: Motivation: Proteases are enzymes that cleave target substrate proteins by catalyzing the hydrolysis of peptide bonds between specific amino acids. While the functional proteolysis regulated by proteases plays a central role in the 'life and death' cellular processes, many of the corresponding substrates and their cleavage sites were not found yet. Availability of accurate predictors of the substrates and cleavage sites would facilitate understanding of proteases' functions and physiological roles. Deep learning is a promising approach for the development of accurate predictors of substrate cleavage events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results: We propose DeepCleave, the first deep learning-based predictor of protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites. DeepCleave uses protein substrate sequence data as input and employs convolutional neural networks with transfer learning to train accurate predictive models. High predictive performance of our models stems from the use of high-quality cleavage site features extracted from the substrate sequences through the deep learning process, and the application of transfer learning, multiple kernels and attention layer in the design of the deep network. Empirical tests against several related state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that DeepCleave outperforms these methods in predicting caspase and matrix metalloprotease substrate-cleavage sites. \n",

      "(i.e. the degree of reduction is less than a certain threshold). This solves the problem of manually setting the number of epochs and reduces chances of overfitting the network to the training set.\n",
      "Balancing the training datasetThe number of cleavage sites is much smaller than the number of noncleavage sites. We apply bootstrapping (Wallace et al., 2011) to tackle this imbalance problem in the training dataset. We visualize this strategy in the 'Bootstrap' part of Figure 1B. Let P and N be the positive set (cleavage sites) and negative set (non-cleavage sites), respectively, and #P and #N be the number of the corresponding positive and negative residues. We selected the same numbers (#P) of negative and positive residues to train a model in each bootstrap iteration. We split the negative residues into n ¼ N=P subsets and we apply n bootstrap iterations to traverse the negative residue and train one prediction model. We repeat this procedure five times to train five prediction models. We use the average output of these five models as the final prediction.\n",

The second is to keep the transferred feature layers frozen, which means that they are fixed during the training of for the target problem. Choosing whether to fine-tune the first n layers of the target network depends on the size of the target dataset. If the dataset is small and the number of parameters is large, fine-tuning may lead to over-fitting and thus these layers should be kept frozen.\n",
      "Figure 44Figure4gives the UMAP plots(McInnes et al., 2018) that visualize feature representations that are automatically learned inside of the DeepCleave model. The UMAP plots cluster the actual feature representations into a two-dimensional space. This figure includes the mapped feature representations for the one-hot encoding, after the attention layer, and for the 2nd fully connected layer. Each dot in the figure represents a positive sample (i.e. a cleavage site for a given protease). Figure4Aand B reveals that the one-hot encoding cannot be directly used to accurately discriminate proteases. The cleavage data for the different proteases are almost randomly distributed within\n",
